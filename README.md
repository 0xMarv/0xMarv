  <strong><code>I don't deploy – I dominate infrastructure.</code></strong>
</p>

## 👋 About Me

I'm currently training to become a **System Engineer**, but I already bring a solid background in **cloud technologies**, **infrastructure automation**, and **system architecture**.

I'm passionate about anything that can be **optimized**, **automated**, and **scaled** – whether it's running on-premises, in the cloud, or across hybrid environments.

Beyond managing systems, I genuinely enjoy **coding**:  
Whether it's for **games**, **web applications**, or fully automated **cloud deployments**, I love building solutions that are not only efficient and elegant – but built to last.

From scripting to serverless, from bare metal to containers:  
> **Infrastructure as Code, smart scripting, and clean development – that’s my thing.**

---

### 🧠 Bonus skills? Absolutely.

- 🔥 Mastering **DDoS mitigation** with custom firewall rules, FreeBSD blackholing, PF & IPFW
- 🔄 **Zero-downtime migrations** – even under pressure
- 🧰 Writing tools that make infrastructure work *for* you, not against you
- ☁️ Turning messy setups into clean, versioned, automated deployments

> **I don't just deploy – I design, automate, and dominate infrastructure.**
